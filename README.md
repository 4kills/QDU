# QDU 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

QDU is an ultra lightweight screenshot tool that allows for quick and easy sharing of screenshots across the web!  
You can either copy them to your clipboard and share from there, save to disk or get a sharable link by uploading the screenshot to a [QDU server](https://github.com/4kills/qdu_server).

The latter can be hosted by you, a friend or someone else in the community! However, QDU is also completely functional in an offline manner, without uploading any data.

**If you condsider using the online option, please read the [Privacy and Security Notice](privacy-and-security-notice) first**.

# Getting Started

## Installation 

Just download the latest executable from [here](https://github.com/4kills/QDU/releases) or clone the repository and compile it yourself!  

QDU requires no installer and can be used right from the .exe. 

After launching the application it can be found in your system tray and be configured from there. 

## Connecting to a QDU Server (optional)

In order to connect and upload to a [QDU server](https://github.com/4kills/qdu_server), you need the address of someone hosting [it](https://github.com/4kills/qdu_server). 

In the options panel (accessible from the tray icon) you may enter an URL on which the server is listening or directly a (public) IP address. You may also enter a port, if your remote server is not listening on the default 1337 port. Lastly, you only need to switch the `Mode` to `Online`.
